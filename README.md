# Obesity Prediction Classification PCA Analysis

## Overview

This project uses the **Obesity Prediction Dataset** to predict the likelihood of obesity in individuals based on factors like age, gender, and physical activity. It applies multiple machine learning classification models, including **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is also used for dimensionality reduction to improve model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about individuals such as their age, gender, height, weight, and physical activity levels. The target variable is whether the individual is obese or not.

**Dataset source**: [Obesity Prediction Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchikakumbhar/obesity-prediction/code?datasetId=6479256&sortBy=voteCount)

## Models Used

1. **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method for binary classification, predicting the probability of an outcome based on independent variables.
2. **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that creates multiple decision trees for improved classification accuracy.
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A supervised learning model that creates a hyperplane to separate different classes.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA was used for dimensionality reduction to improve the models' performance and visualization.
